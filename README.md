# Terraform Infrastructure Project

## Overview

This Terraform project is designed for modularized infrastructure provisioning. The configuration is organized to accommodate various components, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance.

## Project Structure üõ†Ô∏è

The project follows a modular structure to support different infrastructure components:

1. **Root Module (`main.tf`):**
   - Initializes the Terraform configuration.
   - Defines global configuration, providers, and common variables.
   - Declares and configures the main module(s).

2. **Module(s) (`<module>/main.tf`):**
   - Defines specific infrastructure components (e.g., compute, networking).
   - Utilizes local variables, input variables, and outputs.
   - Organized for seamless integration with the root module or other modules.

As the project evolves, additional components can easily be added.
